            <title>Anti-Socinianism, or, A brief explication of some places of holy Scripture, for the confutation of certain gross errours, and Socinian heresies, lately published by William Pynchion, Gent. in a dialogue of his, called, The meritorious price of our redemption, concerning 1. Christ's suffering the wrath of God due to the elect. 2. God's imputation of sin to Christ. 3. The nature of the true mediatorial obedience of Christ. 4. The justification of a sinner. Also a brief description of the lives, and a true relation of the death, of the authors, promoters, propagators, and chief disseminators of this Socinian heresie, how it sprung up, by what means it spread, and when and by whom it was first brought into England, that so we be not deceived by it. / By N.

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow which is done unto me; wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce wrath. I know, and according to the letter, it cannot be denyed, but that theſe words are ſet down by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in the perſon of his own people, being then in great miſery, and of the holy City, then laid waſt by the Chaldees, their profeſſed Enemies; what then? ſays one<note n="l" place="margin">Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> his ſerm.</note> as learned, as the beſt of thoſe that dare oppoſe it. I find, ſaith he, there is not any of the Ancient writers, but do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, yea, and in a manner appropriate this ſpeech to our Saviour Chriſt; and whereſoever they treat of the paſſion, ever this cometh in, to expreſſe the bitterneſs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118687:10"/> and the horrour thereof. And, to ſay the truth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the words ſtrictly, and as they lye before us, they cannot agree with, or be verified of any, but of him, and him only. For though ſome other, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unfitly, may ſay the ſame words, yet it muſt be in a qualified ſenſe: For, in full and perfect proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech, he, and none but he can ſay, <hi>ſi fuerit dolor, ſicut dolor meus;</hi> no day of wrath like to his day: no grief, no ſorrow, no torment to be compared to his, yea his exceeded them all.

                     <p>And to this purpoſe, mark how fully the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> expreſſeth himſelf; Chriſt, ſaith he, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118687:10"/> us from the curſe of the Law, when he was made a curſe for us: (For it is written, curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree) that the bleſſing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c. Which words we take as an anſwer to an objection, occaſioned from the 10. <hi>verſe,</hi> thus; If they be accurſed, that continue not in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law to do them, then all men are accurſed, and the Gentiles are not partakers of the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as is before declared; To this, the Apoſtle applyeth theſe words, Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, that is, to them that believe, there is full redemption from this curſe of the Law, to which they were lyable, Chriſt himſelf having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the curſe for them. For the more cleer illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this anſwer, the Apoſtle gives us a deſcription of our Redemption, in theſe three particulars. 1. The Authour, Chriſt hath redeemed us. 2. The form or manner, being made a curſe for us. 3. The end, which is two-fold. 1. More generally, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come on the Gentiles. 2. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt and the laſt, the Authour and the end, we all agree the difference between us lyes in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or form of our Redemption, expreſſed in theſe words, Who was made a curſe for us. For the better underſtanding whereof, theſe four things are to be enquired after; Firſt, what this curſe is? Secondly, how Chriſt is ſaid to become a curſe? Thirdly, in what nature Chriſt was accurſed. Laſty how far forth Chriſt was accurſed. Firſt, we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what this curſe is? Here <hi>Socinus, Gitichius, Oſtorodius, Smalcius, Muſcorovius, Crellius</hi> with all the reſt, do croud in, and would fain be heard; But let us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118687:11"/> hear the Dialogue, and we hear them all, who now liſpeth not, but expreſly uſeth the ſame Language, and to the very ſame intent and purpoſe with them; which is, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks in this Chapter of a two-fold curſe, of the eternal curſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. of the outward temporary curſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. Namely ſuch a curſe as all men do ſuffer, that are hanged upon a Tree: which curſe the Apoſtle brings in, ſpeaking in a <hi>Rhetorical</hi> manner only, thus, Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law; namely, from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal curſe, at the very ſelf ſame time, when he was made, not that<note n="q" place="margin">Chriſtus non noſtram, ſed aliam quandam ſubiit execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem <hi>Socinus</hi> de Chriſto Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatore.</note> curſe, but a curſe for us, according to that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. and thus the Dialogue with them endeavoureth <hi>fictis illudere verbis,</hi> with a ſhadow to deprive us of the ſubſtance; But to deal truly and uprightly with the Reader, we are to know, that the Apoſtle in the 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> Speaks of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or moral curſe, and in the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> both of the eternal and ceremonial, in neither of which is there any need of Rhetorick or any Rhetorical expreſſions. What a ſtrange, imaginary or illuſory curſe would theſe men frame to themſelves, if they might have their own wills, and make others believe our Saviour under-went? When as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in plain terms, he was made that very curſe that they had deſerved, which continued not in all things written in the book of the Law, to do them. And this doth appear by that place forecited,<note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 21.23.</note> Curſed, even with that moral curſe, is every one that hangeth upon a Tree. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this is made more evident, by proving that the perſon hanged upon a Tree, and accurſed, was a Type of Chriſt. For, if the type bare the ceremonial, 'tis then manifeſt, that the Anti-type bare the moral; that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118687:11"/> is, the eternal curſe. If not only the curſe of every one that is hanged upon a Tree, be ſignified, but alſo Chriſts redemption of us from the curſe of the Law, by being made a curſe for us,<note n="*" place="margin">Deus Ideò ſuſcepit carnem ut maledictum carnis peccatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>We come to the ſecond, namely, how Chriſt is ſaid to be a curſe. For anſwer; He is not ſo by nature: for he is the very natural Son of God; but firſt by voluntary diſpenſation. Secondly, by mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination between the three Perſons of the Deity, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; Thirdly, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and apparent Ordination,<note n="w" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.20.</note> and that before the foundation of the World was laid; Fourthly, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine obſignation,<note n="x" place="margin">Iohn. 6.27.</note> Fiftly, by a ſeaſonable and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſecration; and that firſt by his Baptiſme, in which, ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins,</hi>

                     <p>For the third, in what nature he was made a curſe? We have this anſwer, In his humane nature, conſiſting of body and ſoul, yea in ſoul rather then in body, the ſoul of man being the principal ſeat, and place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence for ſin.</p>
                     <p>For ſaith Chriſt himſelf,<note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 15.19.</note> out of the heart, which in Scripture beareth uſually the name and title of the ſoul, proceedeth evill thoughts, murthers, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. Yet I ſay in both, compleating and making up the humane nature, ſuſtained and ſupported by the Divine, being in Union with it. Here is ſomething to be borne, and meet it is,<note n="a" place="margin">Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> ſer.</note> that every one ſhould bear his own burthen; the nature that had ſinned bear his own ſin; Mans nature had ſinned, and therefore mans nature ought to ſuffer. But that which mans nature ſhould, mans nature could not bear, not the heavy and inſupportable weight of Gods wrath due to ſin: but God could; The one ought, and could
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118687:12"/> not; The other could, but ought not; if he had not bin man, he could not have ſuffered; if he had not bin God, he had ſunk in his ſufferings, and had never bin able to have gone thorow with them. God had no ſhoulders; Man had, but too weak, God knows, to ſuſtain ſo great a weight; So that as he was man, he was lyable, and as he was God he was able, ſaith that learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late<note n="b" place="margin">Pag.</note> to bear the burthen in the heat of the day<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note>. To the laſt, how far forth Chriſt was accurſed? We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thus; There is a two-fold death; a firſt and a ſecond death; in the firſt death there are two degrees, ſeparation of body and ſoul: and the putrifaction of the body ſeparated.

Chriſt was grievouſly afflicted,<note n="x" place="margin">Afflictus &amp; execrabilis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus eſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, quae noſtri locum ſuſtinuit qui irae Dei &amp; maledictioni obnoxii eramus <hi>Calovius</hi> de ſatisfactione Chriſti.</note> and made a curſe, as he ſtood in our ſteed, and took our place and caſe upon him, who were our ſelves Children of wrath, and obnoxious to the curſe of God; yet was he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, and moſt dear to him, in reſpect of his moſt holy, and perfect obedience, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to all his commands; likewiſe, a ſacrifice of a ſweet Savour in regard of the Effect, God being thereby pacified and reconciled to us. So that God inflicted wrath upon him, not as his only beloved Son, but as our ſurety, and one that undertook to bear the penalty for us, that Gods Juſtice being in him fully ſatisfied, we might be freed from that wrath, which otherwiſe might, and that juſtly have bin inflicted on us.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe by this time we have ſufficiently proved againſt the Dialogue, and in him <hi>Socinus,</hi> and all his followers, that Chriſt Jeſus, as our Pledge and ſurety did ſuffer the wrath of God,<note n="*" place="margin">Ira Dei pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata noſtra in filio ſponſore noſtro vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantis tenebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum horrore ſancitur, <hi>Beza in Mar. 15.</hi>
                        </note> being made a curſe for us, yea that very curſe, which we ſhould have ſuffered, or elſe the Apoſtles Argument could not hold, there being in it four terms in reſpect of the diverſity of the ſignification of the word curſe. Hence
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118687:17"/> are two things to be proved by us; one, that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the curſe for us, to declare which, we thus argue, either Chriſt ſuffered the curſe due to us for our ſins, or we ſuffer it our ſelves, or the curſe is not executed; But we ſuffer it not our ſelves, neither is the curſe not executed; for then the truth of the commination and Divine Juſtice ſhould fail. Therefore Chriſt ſuffered the curſe due to us for our ſins. The other, that he ſuffered that very curſe to which we were lyable: this is plain. 1. From the Rule of interpretation rightly laid, not having recourſe to Tropes or Figures, where there is no neceſſity for them. 2. From the Apoſtles alternation, we are freed from the curſe of the Law, Chriſt is made the curſe of the Law for us, which very variation or inverſion doth evidently declare to any ordinary capacity, that Chriſt was made the very true curſe of the Law for us. For the whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyes thus. As Chriſt freed us from the curſe, ſo did he ſuffer the curſe; But Chriſt did ſo free us from the curſe, that he hath <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> truly bin ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the puniſhment, and <hi>damnatory Sentence</hi> of the ſame. 3. From the quality of the curſe; He is made a curſe, the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>WE complained in the beginning of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues want of order, but know not how to help our ſelves; for we reſolve in his own way and method, to give him that anſwer, and the Reader that ſatisfaction, which we intend.

                     <p>For our entrance into the firſt, we ſhall enquire what imputation is, and what is meant thereby, that ſo it may be the better underſtood of what, and what we do affirm. The words <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The very term Impute, taken for judicial laying of that to the charge of a perſon, which is not properly his, but yet juſtly laid to him, and put truly upon his account, is ten times uſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> In which ſenſe we affirm that ſin is imputed to Chriſt, or elſe he could not have ſuffered.

As by one man ſin entred into the World, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed over all men, for that all have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; from whence we collect, that every man that dyes, dyes for ſin, that is, either for his own, or the ſin of ſome other, made his by imputation. Death is not natural to man, as man: For that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him, as he is man, was engraffed into him, and appointed unto him of God, but death is not planted or engraffed into him by God, neither was he by him made lyable to it<note n="e" place="margin">

Is that agreeable to the nature of man, which above all other he abborreth, being accompanied with that, which brings nothing but trouble, anguiſh and vexation to him? whence we ſee that death is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to man, as man; but to man only as a ſinner. Now that Chriſt dyed, the Devils themſelves have not impudence enough to deny, being themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally engaged for the effecting of his death. But let the Dialogue, or any man elſe for him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me in good ſadneſs, was it for his own ſin or for the ſin of others? None can, none dare openly (though theſe black mouth'd <hi>Socinians</hi> do ſecretly mutter ſo much) affirm for his own, therefore it muſt neceſſarily be for the ſin of others.</p>

                     <p>Chriſt was not ſubject to any neceſſity of dying, being as God, immortal, as man, holy and immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

This is a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an undoubted truth, that where there is no Original corruption, there is no actual tranſgreſſion; Chriſt being free from the one, muſt needs be acquit of any ſuſpition of the other; therefore not for his own ſins, but for ours, the guilt whereof being laid upon him, and imputed to him, did he ſuffer that miſery thoſe torments, and that death, that accurſed death, of which we have already ſo fully ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Here the Dialogue, that he may the more cloſely and covertly beguile the over-credulous Reader, which I perceive is his great endeavour, doth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, if not wilfully, corrupt ſome texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; wreſting and wringing them about, to make them ſpeak in his ſenſe, and to his purpoſe, namely, that Chriſt did not bear, as we ſay by imputation, but did bear away our ſins and our iniquities from us.

For the Apoſtle treateth here, not of every, or of any other grace of Chriſt, but of his great and admirable patience only, which is not ſeen, neither doth it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it ſelf, in bearing away, but in bearing and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining the guilt or heavy burthen (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) of our ſins, which lay upon him, and was imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>We come to the next thing to be conſidered, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God himſelf imputed our ſins to Chriſt, which is very neceſſary to be proved, becauſe the Dialogue ſeems to admit of a kind, though indeed a ſtrange kind of imputation, an imputation of men, but not of God; The Jews (ſaith he) laying many crimes to the charge of Chriſt, accounted him a moſt notorious ſinner, and therefore inſtigated <hi>Pilate</hi> the Roman Deputy to puniſh him, not only ſo, but as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118687:22"/> an hainous Malefactor. True, we confeſſe ſo much; but ſo to make him a ſinner by the unjuſt criminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and falſe accuſations of men, as to deny any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſin by God unto him, we cannot grant, leſt we ſhould ſell our birth-right for a meſſe of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For what are all the ſlanderous imputations of men to us? they are neither to us, nor to our behoof: The burthen our ſins muſt be taken from us, and layd upon him, whoſe only ſhoulders are able to undergo ſo great a weight, or elſe we are never the better for his coming in the fleſh among us. We will refer our ſelves to the Holy Scriptures herein, and ſtand or fall according to the determination thereof, which are very conſpicuous and cleer in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>A Prophet<note n="k" place="margin">Iſa. 53.6.</note>, tells us plainly the Lord hath laid upon him, that is Chriſt, the iniquities of us all. I wot well how buſy <hi>Socinus</hi> and his brethen in evill are, leaving no ſtone unturned, to overthrow (if they could) the ſtrength, and corrupt the genuine ſenſe of theſe words, deviſing a new and uncouth interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own, to obſcure the radiant beams of the cordial and comfortable truth herein contained: But all the powers of darkneſs ſhall not be able to do it.</p>
                     <p>For the more full diſcovery whereof; I ſhall refer the judicious Reader to that tract of <hi>Grotius;</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Catholick faith<note n="l" place="margin">De Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione Chriſti, <hi>cap. 1.</hi>
                        </note>, the words themſelves admitting no other ſenſe then this, the Lord (for no creature whether in Heaven or Earth was able for to do it) hath made to meet on him, that is, hath faſtened upon him our ſins, and our iniquities, ſo that he beareth the whole weight and burthen thereof.</p>
                     <p>An Apoſtle<note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> alſo tells us; He, that is God, hath made him ſin for us, which knew no ſin: that we might
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118687:22"/> be made the righteouſneſs of God in him; the adjunct is here to be taken for the ſubject. That the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the truth, may ſhift off the ſtrength and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this place: they would perſwade us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by ſin, a man accounted a ſinner among men; Firſt, without any example to that purpoſe; for the original word is no where ſo taken; and then contrary to the mind of the Apoſtle, who aſcribes this action to God himſelf, plainly affirming that he made Chriſt ſin, who knew no ſin.</p>
                     <p>That the Jews did impute many notorions crimes to Chriſt, accounting him for one ſhamefully wicked and dangerouſly evil, is not to be eſteemed as an act of God, or that he was the Authour thereof: for by his voyce from Heaven, and his miracles on Earth, he declared the contrary, and in all doth atteſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of his Son; Beſides, the Apoſtle oppoſeth ſin and righteouſneſs, we are made the righteouſneſs of God, that is, we are juſtified being ungodly, or freed from Divine Juſtice, which we had deſerved: but Chriſt, that this might be ſo, is made ſin, that is, by reaſon of the guilt of ſin imputed to him, ſuffered Divine Juſtice for us. There is alſo another oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe words of the Apoſtle, He, which knew no ſin, and ſo had not deſerved any puniſhment, hath God made ſin, that is, would have to ſuffer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; even the puniſhment of ſin, which we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Chriſt was innocent, not only in reſpect of the Law of man, but alſo of the Law of God; The force therefore and ſtrength of the oppoſition doth require, that he ſhould alſo ſuffer the puniſhment of the Divine Law. The Apoſtle doth not tell it for news (for it is no new thing) that thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118687:23"/> and harmleſſe, moſt unblameable in their converſation<note n="n" place="margin">Homo quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò voluerit eſſe Spiritualior, tantò praeſens vita ei ſit ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. <hi>Iſod.</hi>
                        </note>, are troubled, moleſted and evilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of evil men; Every ſtory is a Chronicle of this truth, and the whole World the practiſe thereof; what age is not able ſufficiently to furniſh us? But here the Apoſtle noteth ſome ſingular, eminent and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table matter, and what can this be other, then that God ſhould inflict puniſhment upon a perſon, who conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in, and by himſelf, did no way in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ever deſerve it? It is God then that imputes the ſin, and himſelf inflicts the puniſhment thereof; Not but that men, yea and Devils to, may be inſtruments for the execution; but the puniſhment it ſelf proceeds from Cod. For the Apoſtles, when they apply the paſſion of Chriſt to us, and would bring it home to our uſe and benefit, have no reſpect at all to the actings of men in it, or about it; but only of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, 'tis he that hath put him to grief; So that all the foul imputations of the Jews are nothing to this purpoſe. Thus have we in ſome meaſure heard, what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay in this particular; Now whether we ſhould believe God or Man, Prophet and Apoſtle, or <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the Dialogue, judge ye good Readers.</p>
                     <p>Here the whole Socinian band do fire at once, and to ſhew themſelves doughty champions of the black guard, do diſcharge a full volley of moſt horrid blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, even in the very face of the Almighty: If God, ſay they, ſhall impute ſin unto Chriſt, his own innocent and harmleſſe Son, he is unjuſt<note n="*" place="margin">Ille agit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtè, qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitum pro alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro punit, ſed qui illum, qui ſe ſponté pro alterò ad ſupplicium effort, &amp; habet fui, ipſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſ<expan>

                        </note>; Thus, though Chriſt have taken our ſins upon him, and hath
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118687:23"/> engaged for us; yet if God impute ſin to Chriſt, they will be ſo bold, as to impute ſin to God, and charge him with injuſtice: yea, the Dialogue it ſelf, though he appear one of the laſt, is none of the leaſt among them; For he confidently affirms, that God cannot impute ſin to our innocent Saviour; but if he ſhould do ſo, he ſhould be as unjuſt<note n="*" place="margin">Deus verè &amp; ſummè ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus in ſponſere noſtro <hi>Bez. in Rom. 4.25.</hi>
                        </note>; even as the wicked Jews; what high preſumption is it in theſe poor worms thus to reproach the living God, and to charge him fooliſhly? He that reproveth him, let him anſwer it ſaith <hi>Iob</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Iob 39.35.</note>; We may diſcover the ground of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, though there be none for their blaſphemy; Here, here is that <hi>ignis erraticus,</hi> that cauſeth them to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, namely, a vain ſuppoſition, that the works of God are no leſſe ſubject to the Law of nature, and the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then the works of men: and that the work of mans redemption, publiſhed to us only by the Goſpel, is to be ſquared by, and proportioned to the Law of nature engraffed in us, or the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet down as a Rule of life unto us.</p>
                     <p>This they endeavour to maintain by an argument taken from the equal obligation, as well of God, as of man to the ſame, prefixed as a rule to both, and to both a like, beyond which, as man, ſo God himſelf cannot paſſe, but they do (as it were) pull him by the ſleeve, tell him of it, and charge him with injuſtice. For, ſay they, God hath not ordained this Law for men only, namely; The Fathers ſhall not dye for their Children, nor the Children for their Fathers, but every one ſhall bear the puniſhment of his own ſin; But alſo, did after a manner impoſe it upon himſelf, ſpeaking thus by the Prophet<note n="p" place="margin">Ezek. 18.20.</note>, the Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of the Father, neither ſhall the Father
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118687:24"/> bear the iniquity of the Son, but the righteouſneſs of the righteous, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This Socinian argument is patcht up with very groundleſſe, yea ſenſeleſſe and fained ſuppoſitions, the firſt of which is, that God by <hi>Moſes</hi> impoſed the ſame Law upon himſelf, which he had engraven in the hearts of the Gentiles, and delivered to the Jews<note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 24.16.</note>, namely, the Fathers ſhall not be put to death for the Children, nor the Children for the Fathers. That this is falſe may appear by the practiſe of <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> who having reſpect unto this Law did not underſtand it, as to extend it ſelf ſo far as to God, the moſt high and ſupream Law-giver, but to be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and limitted in his vicegerents, and therefore<note n="r" place="margin">2 King. 14.6.</note>, he ſlew not the Children of thoſe that had murthered his Father <hi>Joaſh,</hi> according to that which is written in the book of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We affirm then, that God was not lyable, neither can he poſſibly be ſubject to any external Law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; the reaſon is plain, becauſe his own will is the prime and chiefeſt Rule of Juſtice, who receiveth Laws from none, but preſcribeth Laws to all; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe and original of all juſt Laws engraven in the hearts of men, or by writing committed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and commended to poſterity. Wherefore as God will have no Law preſcribed to his will, which depends not upon the will of any other: So, ſeing his will is in it ſelf holy, and unchangeably juſt, there is no need at all, that he ſhould preſcribe a Law as a Rule of Juſtice unto himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſuppoſition is, that this Evangelical affirmation of God, by which he declares his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that Chriſt by his appeaſing death ſhould ſatisfie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118687:24"/> the debt of our ſins for us, is altogether repugnant to that legal aſſeveration of his, that he would not that the innocent Son ſhould dye for the guilty Father, or the innocent Father for the guilty Son; Both which, though in ſeveral reſpects are moſt true and certain.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God would have Chriſt our Brother accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, being juſtified by the Spirit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared innocent by <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> to be condemned and executed for us that were guilty: becauſe Chriſt by joynt conſent with God his Father appointed himſelf<note n="ſ" place="margin">Aliud eſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum pro alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro puniri invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, aliud pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niri illum qui ſe ſiſtit ipro al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero vadem ſeu ſpoſorem.

                        </note> the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World. A Lamb indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, without blemiſh, ordained for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, even before the Foundations of the World were laid; but in theſe latter times manifeſted to us, whom he hath redeemed from ſin by his moſt precious bloud as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God would not that out of mankind ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Father ſhould dye for the Son, or the Son for the Father; becauſe he knew from all eternity, that no Father or Son could poſſibly be guiltleſſe, proceeding from the corrupt maſſe of mankind, or out of the loynes of ſinfull and degenerate <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo could not be a ſufficient ſacrifice, one for another. Add to this moreover, that among men there was never any yet found, which out of an abſolute purpoſe of mind and immutable conſtancy could be contented to offer up himſelf a ſacrifice unto death, unto ſuch a death, for the ſins of thoſe which were his Enemies, with the like reaſon and reſolution, as our Saviour Chriſt did; Though <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed that they might dye for the Iſraelites their Country-men, yet it was not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118687:25"/> ſo ſimply and abſolutely for them, as Chriſt did for his Elect, but conditionally that is to ſay, upon ſuch terms as ſtood not with the liking, nor were agreeable to the good will and pleaſure of God. Whereas Chriſt, not conditionally, but ſimply and abſolutely according to the decree of his Father, laid down his life, as willing to ſuffer what men or Devils could do againſt him, and was accepted of him. We might multiply reaſons for this, why God ſhould free us, who deſerved to be puniſhed unto all eternity, and ſhould lay that puniſhment, which was due to us (though in reſpect of time, not unto eternity) upon his own moſt innocent harmleſſe and beloved Son, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any, the leaſt ſuſpition of wrong or injuſtice in God<note n="*" place="margin">Iuſtus eſt Deus, &amp; omni a juſtè diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, &amp; eum ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men qui non debet puniri, condemnat.

                     <p>But leaſt the Dialogue ſhould think we had quite forgotten him, we return again unto him, finding him in the very ſame place where we left him, who tells us, that if Chriſt had ſtood a guilty perſon before God, by his imputing our ſins unto him, he could not have bin a fit perſon in Gods eſteem to perform the office of a Mediatour for our redemption.

                     <p>Before we paſſe any further, who can forbid us, that we may not marry theſe two together, and make one entire propoſition of them, namely this, That God did impute the guilt of our ſins unto our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Saviour, as unto our Pledge, and Surety, which indeed was the impulſive cauſe of all his ſufferings; being then thus joyned together by us, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of a Juſtice of Peace.

Therefore the latter: The iniquities of us all did God make to meet upon him, and by the reaſon thereof, laid upon him alſo the puniſhment of thoſe iniquities; What other conſequence can proceed from hence, but that Chriſt, ſeeing he could not be lyable to puniſhment for his own ſin, being free from all ſin, and every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil, neither was there guile found in his lips; for our ſins being made ſubject to the ſame, had the ſins of others truly and indeed imputed to him? The cauſe alſo of this imputation is juſt; becauſe Chriſt having taken the Mediatorital office upon himſelf, by the joynt concurrence of his Father, being willing, freely and of his own accord to be deputed in our place and ſteed, hence our ſins were by right imputed to him, after he became a Surety for us<note n="x" place="margin">Naemo quâ innocens puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri poteſt, ſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocens quatenus reorum vas fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus eſt, omnino puniri poteſt docentum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine pro qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſe ſiſtit. Eſſenius, lib. <hi>2.</hi> ſect. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi> de Satisfactione Chriſti.</note>. In an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the debter and the bondſ-man or Surety are reckoned and conſidered but as one perſon; neither is it any injuſtice at all to require the debt of the one, as well as the other, ſeeing the one would freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily engage for the other; Yea more eſpecially of the Surety, when it manifeſtly appears, as in our caſe it doth, that the debter himſelf is no way able to make ſatisfaction; Chriſt therefore paid that which we did
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118687:26"/> we, as <hi>David</hi> himſelf ſpeaking in the perſon of our Saviour<note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 69.4.</note>, ſaith, I reſtored that which I took not away, or I payed that, which I did not owe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, from the manner of Gods dealing with Chriſt: He, which knew no ſin ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note>, did God make ſin, yea a curſe<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note>, for us; So then the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will lye thus, He which was made ſin and a curſe for others, muſt needs have the ſins and guilt of others imputed to him; But Chriſt was made ſin and a curſe for others; Therefore muſt he of neceſſity have the ſin and guilt of others imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, namely, that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> we ſhall a little more fully expreſſe our ſelves concerning it;</p>
                     <p>For the latter, we have no more at this time to ſay to it, though much more might be ſpoken of it. He was made ſin, ſaith the Apoſtle; by ſin, whether we underſtand a ſinner, as ſome, or a ſacrifice for ſin, as others do earneſtly contend to have it, it is all to one purpoſe, and come both to one paſſe; For from both the Doctrine of imputation is inferred; If a ſacrifice for ſin, it is to free us; If a ſinner, it was by reaſon of our guilt imputed to him, and by God his Father laid upon him. And therefore <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theophilact,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> affirm, that Chriſt was made ſin, not only in reſpect of thoſe afflictions and that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he ſuffered for our ſins; but alſo, and eſpecially in regard of imputation, the guilt of our ſins being charged on him. Likewiſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Enchiridion</hi> ad <hi>Laurentium.</hi> Ipſe peccatum &amp; nos juſtitia, non noſtra ſed Dei, non in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, ſed in ipſo, ſicut ipſe pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp;c.</note> ſaith, as we are made righteouſneſs, not ours, but of God, not in us, but in him: So he was made ſin, not his, but ours, not in him, but in us; and yet laid upon him by juſt imputation. Hence it is that Chriſt is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118687:27"/> pleaſed to charge himſelf with our ſins, even after ſuch a manner, and upon ſuch terms, as if they were his own, for ſo he calls them<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 69.5.</note>, my ſins are not hid from thee; So that Chriſt is made ſin for us<note n="*" place="margin">Et ſi pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum victima ex Hebraeorum idiotiſmo, &amp;c.

                     <p>Thirdly, from the deſignation of the meritorious cauſe of Chriſt our Saviours paſſion; for if our ſins were the meritorious cauſe of his ſufferings, and he dyed by the merit thereof, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that our ſins were imputed to him; But the firſt is true, becauſe he dyed for ſins and for iniquities. Therefore the latter. For the further confirmation whereof, beſides thoſe places of Scripture formerly quoted by us, the Reader may pleaſe to peruſe thoſe following, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. alſo <hi>cap.</hi> 8.3. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. all which neceſſarily conclude the ſame.

                     <p>Fourthly, from the attribution of ſin; for whereas our ſins and fooliſhneſſes are aſcribed to Chriſt, that is, thoſe ſins which proceed from folly and blindneſs of mind in us, it cannot otherwiſe be, but that all our other iniquities ſhould be imputed to him alſo; For theſe<note n="d" place="margin">

                        </gap> as our Pledge and Surety take them upon himſelf; For ſo in the Pſalm before cited, Chriſt thus expreſſeth himſelf to his Father, Lord thou knowſt my fooliſhneſs, and my ſins are not hid from thee. That the Meſſias, our Mediatour doth ſpeak in this Pſalm, the boldeſt and moſt daring Socinian hath not the front to deny, if any of them ſhould, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the puniſhments, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. &amp;c. as alſo the cauſe and deſcription of his reproach, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. &amp;c. would eaſily convince them; which can truly be ſpoken of, or ſafely applyed to none other but him; together with drinking of Gall and Vinegar, not a doſe of Oxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel ſweet and ſour, but things ſharp and bitter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. the enſuing judgments upon the hard and obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Jews, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. Laſtly, the explication hereof in diſtinct parts in the New Teſtament, do all ſtand forth and give a cleer evidence of the ſame; and is with one conſent allowed by <hi>Hilarius, Athanaſius, Auguſtinus, Coſſiodorus, Euthymius,</hi> and all the Orthodox Fathers of the Church; Hence therefore we conclude, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever paying for, or reſtoring that, which another
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118687:28"/> violently took away doth ſubject himſelf to moſt grievous pains, complaining of his ſins and fooliſhneſs, being himſelf free from all manner of iniquity and tranſgreſſion, muſt needs have the ſins, fooliſhneſs, and violence of others imputed to him, which as his own, he aſcribeth and appropriateth to himſelf. But Chriſt paying for that, which others had violently taken away, that is, the honour due to the Majeſty of God, in diſobeying his holy and juſt commands, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected himſelf to moſt grievous pains, and doth miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably complain of his ſins and offences, being himſelf free from all ſin and iniquity; Therefore the ſins of others, that is, of the Elect, and their violence is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, from the prefiguration of types cleerly manifeſted in the Levitical ſervices; For as the ſins of the Iſraelites were imputed unto their legal ſacrifices, for which they were offered<note n="e" place="margin">Levit. 4. and 5. cap.</note>: So by the force and ſtrength of the Analogie of type and Anti-type, the ſins of all Gods people muſt in the new Teſtament, and ſervice of the Goſpel, be imputed to Chriſt, as our only Evangelical and propitiatory ſacrifice.

                        </note>, that he ſhould bear them, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118687:28"/> is, the puniſhment of them, which we had deſerved. Nor was this a vain ceremony, or an idle and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable cuſtome among them; but both for matter &amp; manner commanded and preſcribed by God himſelf. Beſides, whoever happened to touch this Goat was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, till he had cleanſed himſelf by waſhing, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.26. Whereby was ſignifyed that Chriſt the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type hereof, was an imputed ſinner, and ſo made a curſe for us. He then that would perſwade us, that Chriſt did not bear our ſins by imputation, did never truly conſider, or well underſtand the Anagoly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this type and the Anti-type; for if he had, he could not but be convinced hereby. Yet let me tell you, there is ſome, and that no ſmall difference in the manner of bearing, though the Dialogue, with other Socinians, will admit of none. Chriſt, I ſay, did bear our ſins after another manner, then this goat did bear the ſins of the Iſraelites; For this goat did bear them typically or Sacramentally, but Chriſt did bear them really and ſubſtantiall, he was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, and ſo was not this goat for theirs. He that will undertake to prove the contrary, had need take even <hi>ad Graecas Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendas,</hi> to do the ſame.</p>
                     <p>All this while we have but chaffed the wax, we come now to ſet on the ſeal; for what are all theſe ſufferings of Chriſt to us, or the imputation of our ſins to him, if Gods Juſtice be not hereby ſatisfyed, and we freed from the wrath to come? Who are yet in our ſins, and ſo lyable to ſuffer the eternal puniſhment due unto us for the ſame. We ſhall now therefore prove, that all this was done by way of ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, and ſo conclude this part alſo with ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118687:29"/> caution, and ſound advice to the conſcientious Reader.</p>
                     <p>The ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſ. 85.10.11.</note> telleth it for news, and joyfull news it is indeed; and therefore compoſes a ſong, this very ſong for the ſolemnity thereof; That Mercy and Truth are met together, that righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other, &amp;c. It would be worth our while, to make ſome enquiry, how, and for what cauſe they came at firſt aſunder, ſeeing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are no ſtrangers, all four in the boſome of God from all Eternity; Attributes all four of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided eſſence? Not of themſelves then, nor by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any cauſe of theirs, were they thus divided, and ſet at ſuch a diſtance, that it was news to ſee them meet, and greet thus kindly and affectionately; but the quarrel was ours, and about us did they at firſt part company.</p>
                     <p>And a ſweet Singer of our <hi>Iſrael</hi> to<note n="i" place="margin">Biſh. Andrew. in his Sermon.</note> layes it forth thus; If at the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh (in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration where of this Pſalm was pend) theſe Attributes of God did meet; ſure, ſaith he, at <hi>Adams</hi> fall, they might be ſaid to part; It was <hi>Adams</hi> cauſe then, and ſo ours, that firſt divided Heaven, yea the very Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes in God, and ſo in a manner God himſelf; And thus they parted firſt. Nor could it otherwiſe be ſaid by the Apoſtle<note n="k" place="margin">Col. 1.20.</note>, that Chriſt reconciled all things in Heaven and Earth, if there had not bin in Heaven ſome what to be taken up.</p>
                     <p>Mercy and Truth had met before, but no comfort to us at that meeting, they met indeed, but inſteed of <hi>Oſculatae ſunt,</hi> as here, kiſſing; it was <hi>altercatae ſunt,</hi> in reſpect of us killing, that that meeting did bring forth. While Mercy and Peace would have <hi>Adams,</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:118687:29"/> and ſo our caſe relieved, Righteouſneſs and Truth would by no means conſent unto it. The Plea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them at this meeting is excellently and eligantly drawn up by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Bernard</hi>

                        </note>. In which Mercy thus began, for out of her propenſity &amp; readineſs to do good, ſhee's here, ſhee's there, ſhee's every where moſt forward; therefore he brings her in as the firſt Speaker; Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is, or rather ſhee her ſelf is, an inclination to pitty ſuch as are in miſery, and if ſhee can, relieve them too, though in themſelves they deſerve it not. And her plea is<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 89.47.</note>, <hi>nunquid in vanum?</hi> What hath God made all men for nought? What profit<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 30.9.</note> is in this bloud? Hath God forgotten to be gracious, and will he be no more entreated? His <hi>pris ſu ſurris,</hi> with theſe and the like holy whiſperings, as he terms them, did ſhee enter into the very bowels of God, making them yearn and melt into compaſſion towards the works of his own hands. And certainly, if there had bin none to ſtand up againſt us, there might have bin ſome hope, that Mercy would have prevailed for us. But Truth muſt be heard to, and ſhe layes in juſt matter of exception, pleading thus, <hi>Deus erat verbum,</hi> what is God, but his word? his word was to <hi>Adam, morte morteris,</hi> thou ſhalt dye the death; So to the Sons of <hi>Adam, anima quae peccaverit,</hi> the ſoul that ſinneth, that ſoul ſhall dye. God may not falſifie his word, that may not, muſt not be. Then ſteps up righteouſneſs and ſeconds her, and her plea is, that God, as he is true of his word, ſo is he righteous in his works, <hi>reddere ſuum cuique,</hi> to give to each his own, and ſo to the ſinner <hi>ſtipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium peccati,</hi> the wages that he hath earned, that is, death.

                     <p>The contention ſtayes not here, but every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to make it their own caſe, and ſee themſelves high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in it. For ſayes righteouſneſs, what ſhall become of me, or what uſe at all of Juſtice, if God ſpare ſinners, that have thus offended? And what uſe of mee, ſayes Mercy, the ſweeteſt Attribute of the Deity, if God ſpare them not? Here is hard hold indeed, inſomuch as <hi>Perij, niſi homo moriatur,</hi> ſayes Juſtice, I dye, if he dye not; and <hi>Perij, niſi mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiam conſequatur,</hi> ſayes Mercy, if he dye, I dye to; To this paſſe it came, and upon theſe terms brak up their meeting, and ſo they parted each from other. <hi>Terras Aſtraea reliquit,</hi> away flings Juſtice up to Heaven; Mercy ſtays behind, and keeps poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed man company.</p>
                     <p>For where ſhould Mercy be<note n="n" place="margin">Ubi enim miſericordia eſſet, ſi cum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſero non eſſet? <hi>Hugo?</hi>
                        </note>, if with miſery ſhee ſhould not be? Peace being grieved to ſee this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, plyes her hard between both, and doubles her endeavour to get (if poſſible) a meeting upon ſome better terms, to reconcile theſe two great and glorious Attributes of God, ſet them at rights, or elſe we might be ſure it would go wrong with us. Our Salvation all this while doth, as it were, lye a bleeding.</p>
                     <p>The Plea hangs, and we ſtand, but as Priſoners at the bar, not knowing what to do, or what in the end will become of us.</p>
                     <p>Fain would Peace procure a meeting; Mercy longs to ſee that day; Juſtice ſhee is willing to; where then lyes the fault? only ſhee ſtands upon terms of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>

                     <p>Juſtice elſe ſhould be no Juſtice, and righteouſneſs ſhould not be righteous. If ſhee remain unſatisfyed, there is no hope at all for us: but if ſhee be once ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, all is well.</p>
                     <p>The whole matter then reſts upon her ſatisfaction, and <hi>hic labor, hoc opus,</hi> here is the work indeed; how to ſatisfie her to her mind, that ſo ſhee may be content, content to ſave us, and to ſet us free. All the World cannot do this, not render unto Juſtice ſuch, and ſo compleat a ſatisfaction, as may procure this from her.

                     <p>The firſt, of which we take from the meritorious cauſe of Chriſt his death; Chriſt ſuffered and dyed for our ſins whence we argue thus, He, that taking upon him our nature, hath therein undergone all the ſufferings, which were due to the offenders, and ſuch as were guilty, whoſe perſons he repreſents: So that his chaſtiſements have ceaſed in the pacification of the Imponent, his Sacrifice bin the expiation of all the offences, his ſtripes have brought health and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the delinquent; He hath truly and fully made ſatisfaction for them; But Chriſt Jeſus, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>THE Dialogue having hitherto denied Chriſts ſuffering the wrath of God, due to the Elect for their ſins by way of ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, as alſo the imputation of their ſin unto Chriſt, as their Surety, though very immethodically, and out of place, preferring the effect before the cauſe; leſt he ſhould fall into another foul abſurdity in his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, to deny the ſubject of the queſtion, doth preſent us with a new thing of nothing in the ſteed thereof: And becauſe he hath prevailed with ſome, and they perhaps ſuch as vvill not give their heads for the vvaſhing, it may be Maſters in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to comply vvith him, he expects the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118687:36"/> hovers about ſo long in generals, as that, me thinks, he ſeems deſirous, that his Reader ſhould underſtand more, then he is willing to expreſſe. And ſeeing he is ſo loth to tell us, what this new knack is, which he hath bin ſo long a hammering on the Socinian an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and what he means by his Mediatorial obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we will take the pains to ſift him a little, and ſee if we can bolt it out; and here at laſt it comes, and this it is, Chriſts Mediatorial obedience, ſaith he, is made up of certain actions, performed by him (not in way of obedience to the Moral Law; for all ſuch actions he performed as a godly Jew, and as man only<note n="*" place="margin">Rank Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme.

                     <p>In oppoſition then to this new no obedience, we will put into the other ſcale, that which we underſtand by the true Mediatorial obedience of Chriſt, that ſo the Reader, whoſe judgment is free, may plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118687:36"/> It is then the whole conformity of Chriſt, God-Man in both Natures Divine and humane, to the will of his Father, doing and ſuffering all things needfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſatisfaction of Divine Juſtice; freeing alſo thereby the Elect in whoſe room &amp; ſteed he dyed and ſuffered, from thoſe eternal miſeries and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to which they were lyable. This is called the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt; which diviſion is not allowed in reſpect of the ſeveral cauſes, but the circumſtances only; for no obedience in reſpect of the cauſe can be ſaid to be paſſive, but active only. Chriſt therefore taking upon him our perſon, as well by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſuffering; ſubjected himſelf to the Law of God for us, fulfilling the ſame by his moſt perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, even to the death of the croſſe, by which he compleated and perfected al his other ſufferings. That this is ſo, doth manifeſtly appear by the Apoſtle<note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 3.31.</note> by faith ſaith he, we eſtabliſh the Law; Now faith doth eſtabliſh the Law theſe two wayes; It was the firſt voyce of the Law, in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhall dye the death; after that it ſpake thus, curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, that are written in the Law to do them; Theſe threatnings of the Law, we eſtabliſh by faith, becauſe by faith we teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that they are not in vain, and to no purpoſe, ſeeing it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould dye, and endure the curſe of the Law for us, that we might be redeemed from the ſame. Therefore firſt of all, by faith we confirm and eſtabliſh the truth of the threatnings of the Law. The other voyce of the Law is, he that doth theſe things ſhall live in them, this alſo we eſtabliſh by faith, becauſe we believe we are juſtified freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the performance of the Law in reſpect of our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118687:37"/> ſelves, but not ſo in reſpect of Chriſt, who that he might ſatisfie the Law for us, was lyable to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling and accompliſhing thereof with moſt exact and perfect obedience, as every way moſt neceſſary and convenient.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place therefore we are truly ſaid to eſtabliſh the Law by faith, becauſe we believe that in Chriſt we have perfectly fulfilled it, even with that very obedience that the Law required. Alſo the ſame Apoſtle<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> ſeeing, we could not perform the things conteined in, and commanded by the Law, in or by our ſelves, we have performed them in the perſon of our Mediatour, who hath taken off the threatnings of the Law, by ſatisfying the penalty of it, and ſuffering the utmoſt that by the rigour thereof could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him; as alſo hath fulfilled the precepts of the Law, by his moſt entire and perfect obedience to the ſame.</p>
                     <p>We ſtood engaged unto God by a double debt, one was the ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This debt being laid upon us in the Creation, vvas ſeverely exacted from us by the Lavv; The other, having failed in this, is to give full and ample ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Juſtice of God for the non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance hereof; Having broken this Lavv of God, holy in it ſelf, and eaſy to be performed by us, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the holineſs of our Creation, in both theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <note n="w" place="margin">Joh. 1.17.</note>, the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt; for how could the Law be given to Chriſt, by whom grace and truth were conveighed to men, to whom the Law only was preſcribed? Take a few arguments the more to ſtrengthen this, and we will paſſe unto the next.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, as Chriſt laid down his life, not by conſtraint, but freely for us: even ſo alſo did he freely ſubject himſelf unto the Law, being no ſmall degree of that obedience which he performed; But the former is true<note n="x" place="margin">Joh. 10.18.</note>, no man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down my ſelf. Alſo he, that is Chriſt, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the ſhame. And therefore the latter muſt needs be ſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if Chriſt being in the form of God, freely took upon him the form of a Servant, that he might manifeſt his obedience to his Father; then of himſelf he was not a Servant of the Law, nor in this condition lyable to the Law. But the former is true<note n="z" place="margin">Phil. 2.7, 8.</note>, he made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was found in the likeneſs of men, and became obedient, &amp;c. Therefore the latter.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, that which was only our School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3.24.</note>, cannot alſo be ſaid to be a School-maſter unto Chriſt; for what ſhould it teach him? or whether ſhould it bring him? But the former is true; Therefore the latter.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing is now to be conſidered by us, namely, that Chriſt fulfilled the Law for us, and in our ſteed<note n="*" place="margin">Pro nobis eam in carne noſtra imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. <hi>Joſſanus. Rom. 8. pag. 26.</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118687:40"/> us with many bitter reproaches, for believing, and maintaining of the ſame, but all in vain: for they cannot ſhake us from our aſſured confidence herein, being ſo ſtrongly confirmed and maintained by the Scriptures, as we find it is; and that firſt, partly by that which hath bin ſaid already; if Chriſt were not lyable to the Law in reſpect of himſelf, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he truly fulfilled, it is then moſt certain that he fulfilled the Law for others. See what he ſpoke to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 3.15.</note>, it becometh us to fulfill all righteouſneſs; So<note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 5.17.</note> I am not come, ſaith he, to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfill it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, alſo partly by the opinion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note>, for what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh. God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh; where the fulfilling of the Law is aſcribed to the Son of God, which was impoſſible to be performed by us, that the righteouſneſs of the Law ſhould be fulfilled in us by faith, that is, in Chriſt Jeſus. Moreover we may peruſe that of the Apoſtle<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 5.18.</note>, and that to the <hi>Philipians, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, from that Axiome of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> Chriſt ſaith he, is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth; for what elſe is that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the end of the Law, but the complement, and perfect fulfilling of the ſame? But for whom hath he fulfilled the Law? Not for himſelf; but for us, that believing in him, who hath done this for us, we might be juſtified.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, from the imputation of righteouſneſs<note n="g" place="margin">Phil. 3 5.</note>, that I may be found in him, ſaith the Apoſtle, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118687:41"/> that which is through the faith of Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">Quam quia non habemus in nobis, Deus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis gratuitò donat. <hi>Calvin. in Gal. 3.6.</hi>
                        </note>, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith; Hence we argue; If the righteouſneſs of Chriſt be truly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, it is neceſſary alſo that it ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and improved, yea performed for us, that is in our ſteed; But it is truly imputed to us<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 5.18.</note>; Therefore it is neceſſary it ſhould be imployed, improved and performed for us.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, from the very end of Chriſts being ſubject to the Law; from whence alſo we conclude; If Chriſt of his own accord ſubjected himſelf to the Law, that he might redeem us from the Law, and that we might obtain the adoption of Sons, it were requiſite that Chriſt ſhould compleat and fulfill the Law for us. But the former is true; Therefore the latter.</p>
                     <p>Thus then we ſee, not for himſelf did Chriſt fulfill the Law of God, as <hi>Socinus</hi> and our Dialogue (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him only as a godly Jew) would have it, but for us<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtus pro nobis eſt in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus pro nobis obedivit patri: pro nobis bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zatus, paſſus, mortuus, reſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatus, glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus. <hi>Sympho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> Cathol.</note>, and in our ſteed, did he compleat the ſame, though they never ſo much oppoſe it.</p>
                     <p>And ſo we come to our queſtion again; Chriſt was either doing or ſuffering, ſuffering or doing<note n="i" place="margin">Chriſtus in vita habuit actionem paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam, aut paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem activam.</note>, even during the whole courſe of his life; his triumph was upon the croſſe, a little before his death, when he had procured deliverance from Hell, and right and intereſt to Heaven, then was the perfect conſummation of his obedience: For, ſaith the Apoſtle<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 9.15.</note>, by the death of the Mediator, (not his bodily death only, as the Dialogue falſly and fainedly would have it, but his whole ſufferings both in ſoul and body, the cloſe and concluſion whereof was death) do we receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of an everlaſting inheritance; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he was about it and all things in the way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

                     <p>Secondly, how Chriſt could obey, being God, and <label type="milestone">

Chriſt as God and man, may both obey and ſatisfie: For as there are in Chriſt, as we have proved, two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct natures; So there are two diſtinct operations of the ſaid natures; And as the ſaid natures united, make one Mediator: So the operations concurring and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united in one make out, and compleat the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound work of this Mediator, Therfore the obedience of Chriſt, being the work of a Mediator, hath in it the operations of both natures; The ſupport, ſtrength and ſufficiency is from the God-head, the practiſe, exerciſe or execution of obedience is from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                     <p>Obedience is properly a ſubjection of the will, in reaſonable creatures, to the will of God, now the will of the God-head is one and the ſame in all the perſons;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118687:44"/> Chriſt therefore becomes obedient, and yeelds ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection only in reſpect of the will of the Man-hood, in which he performs obedience, and the operation of the God-head, in this great and myſterious work, is to make the ſaid obedience meritorious; So that it is not only the thing done, but the Perſon by whom, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God-Man, that hath procured the Fathers merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Atonement, of which the Diologue makes ſo much mention, and in which he is ſo miſtaken; In this reſpect do I underſtand thoſe expreſſions, of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note n="ſ" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.18.</note>, God was in Chriſt reconciling, the World unto himſelf.

                     <p>Hence then, ſay we, ariſeth the true value, price and dignity of the obedience of Chriſt, being ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who did, and ſuffered theſe things for us and our redemption.

                     <p>Our third queſtion then for the further cleering <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Here the Dialogue takes an occaſion, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I know not, to quarrel with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> for an errour of theirs on the one hand, unleſſe it be, that he may the better and ſooner prevail with his over-confident Reader, and ſo carry him into an errour on the other, cunningly caſting out one Devil by another, and yet the latter more dangerous, if not more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then the former. For neither one drop of bloud, as he chargeth them, nor all the bodily ſufferings of Chriſt, as we charge him to ſay, but the perfect ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law for us, and the ſatisfying Divine Juſtice incenſed againſt us, even the whole obedience
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118687:46"/> of Chriſt; is that by which we are redeemed from, and diſcharged of that debt and penalty, to which we were lyable, and for which we ſtood accountable.</p>
                     <p>The Dialogue, <hi>auribum lupum tenet,</hi> finding it too hard a matter to prove what he had undertaken, that is, That Chriſts natural, or bodily death only, is the meritorious price of our redemption, falls ſtrangly off, and betakes himſelf unto an other matter; For not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to confirm by argument, he will perplex with amazement, his leſſe attentive Reader, telling him, that the Jews and Romanes did not put Chriſt to death, but that he himſelf ſeperated his ſoul from his body, ſhed his own bloud, and did (as he expreſſes it) actuate his own death, contrary to the very letter of the Scriptures<note n="y" place="margin">Act. 2.23.</note> where <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon chargeth them home with the cruel killing of Chriſt the Lord, ſaying, <hi>him have yea taken, and by wicked hands have crucifyed and ſlain.</hi> Again<note n="z" place="margin">Act. 3.15.</note>, <hi>and have killed the Prince of life,</hi> What our bleſſed Saviour, ſpeaks in <hi>Iohn</hi>

We ſay, Chriſt dyed willingly, we cannot, dare not ſay wilfully, which he muſt needs do, if the Language of the Dialogue may paſſe for currant, that he ſhed his own bloud, and did actuate his own death.

                     <p>What the Dialogue would force upon our belief from that place of <hi>Iohn</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 6.63.</note>, namely, that the humanity of Chriſt, which he underſtands by the word fleſh, doth not profit us, is in the firſt place a meer contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to himſelf, having altogether pleaded for the bodily ſufferings of Chriſt hitherto; then we averre, that it is not to be found in, or gathered from the words: for the beſt Expoſitors tell us, that by fleſh there is meant any natural food, and not the fleſh of Chriſt, giving this reaſon for it; whereſoever ſay they, Chriſt ſpeaketh of his own fleſh, there is the Pronoune My, added to it; or elſe he expreſſeth it thus, the fleſh of the Son of man; but there is neither the one, nor the other; and therefore cannot be meant of the fleſh of Chriſt. <hi>They are exceedingly miſtaken,</hi> ſays <hi>Schar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>

                        </note>, <hi>in the ſenſe and meaning of our Saviours Words, who by fleſh would have his humanity, by Spirit, his Deity to be ſignified or underſtood.</hi> But ſhould we let this paſſe for granted; which muſt not be, that the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt doth not profit us; muſt it therefore follow, that his obedience to the Law doth not profit us, nor his fulfilling of the ſame for us? Did ever any that pretended the leaſt knowledge in the Rudiments
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118687:47"/> of Art, fetch a concluſion ſo far wide of the premiſſes? But what ſhall we ſay to theſe <hi>Socinians,</hi> whom no rules of Art are able to keep within compaſſe of ſound Reaſon, nor texts of Scripture, within the bounds of true Religion, but that they break through, and run over all to beguile us in the one, and betray us in the other? <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes report of a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man named <hi>Phea,</hi> who rob'd all paſſengers that came by her Pallace. Theſe, theſe <hi>Socinians,</hi> the Dialogue and his fellows, are like unto her; For none can eſcape their hands; They rob God of his Juſtice, mercy and wiſdome; Chriſt of his merit and ſatisfaction; man of all ſound and ſolid means of Salvation, leaving him in a worſe condition, then the thieves left that poor man, that went down from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Iericho,</hi> not half, but ſtark dead, without any help or hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. I ſhall beſtow upon the Dialogue and his high admirers, with the reſt of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Brethren, but this one argument, and ſo I will conclude this part alſo with a friendly advice to all Chriſtian Readers.</p>
                     <p>That opinion which taketh away the means, by which God is revealed to be infinitely juſt, merciful and wiſe, making alſo the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and his perfect fulfilling of the Law, a vain and needleſſe thing, is moſt heretical, impious and blaſphemons; But this opinion takes away the means by which Gods Juſtice, mercy and wiſdome are revealed to be infinite, makes Chriſts full and perfect ſatisfaction a vain, ſuperfluous and needleſſe thing. Therefore it is a moſt heretical, impious and blaſphemous opinion.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay this is a hard and a heavy charge; but if I make it not plain and evident, let me bear the blame, among all judicious and underſtanding men for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118687:48"/> ever; for which purpoſe, and the better accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof, we will diſcend unto particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that which reveals God to be infinitely <hi>juſt</hi> is, that he cannot be reconciled to men, that have ſinned againſt him, and provoked his diſpleaſure towards them, without execution of his Juſtice<note n="*" place="margin">Ita offenſi Patris ſempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Secondly, when Gods infinite <hi>Iuſtice</hi> was ſo ſtrict, that nothing could ſatisfy it, or redeem man from the power of it, but a price of infinite value laid down for him; and when all the World was not able to find out ſuch an unvaluable price or conſideration, Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>wiſdome</hi> having in her hand from all eternity, for this very purpoſe, this tranſcendent treaſure, this great and ineſtimable price, did in due time, ſhadowing it in the ſimilitude of fraile and ſinfull fleſh, depoſite it for us, making hereby full and real ſatisfaction for every one that ſhall by the hand of faith lay hold upon it, and make a right application of it; and this is that, which reveals Gods infinite wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in that God the Father would in this caſe, and for this purpoſe, give his own only begotten Son, out of his boſome, to be humbled in our nature, to obey, ſuffer, and make full ſatisfaction for poor miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men; and in that the Son would willingly and of

                        </note>. For the <hi>Dialogues</hi> argument we paſſe it by, not as unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but becauſe we have ſufficiently proved the one already, namely, that the guilt of our ſins was made Chriſts by Gods imputation thereof unto him, and we ſhall by Gods aſſiſtance in due time make good the other alſo, that is to ſay, that Chriſts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſatisfaction is made ours, by Gods imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof unto us.</p>
                     <p>That Chriſt did not perform <hi>perfect obedience</hi> to the Law of God, becauſe he was not a <hi>married man,</hi> is more then the Dialogue is willing plainly to affirm, and yet in effect he ſaith as much, becauſe he did not perform all manner of acts of obedience, which God in that condition requires of us. Our anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is, in as much as Chriſt being himſelf an infinite
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118687:55"/> perſon and our Surety, performed al that was required of him, and more then ever in our beſt condition could be expected from us, he performed full and perfect obedience for us; He fulfilled all righteouſneſs, and by it all are perfectly righteous that believe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men or Women, married or unmarried. And therefore this ſilly ſhift is to no purpoſe; Would the Dialogue bu undreſſe his brames, take off, and lay a ſide, theſe and ſuch like phanatick toyes, that gingle about his underſtanding, God might receive more <hi>glory,</hi> the Church more <hi>peace,</hi> himſelf more <hi>comfort,</hi> others more <hi>benefit,</hi> by, or from the ſtudy and practiſe of thoſe Truths, which lend directly and neceſſarily to <hi>edification</hi> and <hi>ſalvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For fear this will not be, we will leave wiſhing and woulding, and return to the proſecution of the matter we have in hand; We are juſtified by the <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>compleat righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> by which the <hi>Law</hi> is fulfilled, the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God ſatisfied, and we delivered from that wrath which we had deſerved<note n="*" place="margin">Communis omnium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrorum ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, neque quòd ad rem attinet, quiſquam è no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris aliter ſcripſit aut ſenſit.</note>; all which we will wind up upon this one <hi>bottome,</hi> and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in this one argument; By that righteouſneſs we are juſtified, by which the <hi>Law</hi> is fully ſatisfied; By the righteouſneſs of Chriſt the <hi>Law</hi> is fully ſatisfied; Therefore by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt are we juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                     <p>For the proof of the Propoſition, three things are to be granted; Firſt, that whoſoever is juſtified, is made juſt by ſome righteouſneſs: For to think that a man ſhould be juſtified without any Juſtice, is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as to imagine a man to be clothed without ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Secondly, that all true righteouſneſs is a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> to the Law of God, which is the <hi>perfect Rule</hi>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:118687:55"/> of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> inſomuch, that what is not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Law, is called, and that juſtly to, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, ſin: Thirdly, that there can be no juſtification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law be fulfilled<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duens nostram carnem noſtro nomine perfectè praeſtitit le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem.</note>, either by our ſelves, or ſome other for us; For our Saviour Chriſt proteſted when he came to juſtifie and redeem us, that he came <hi>not to break,</hi> but <hi>to fulfill the Law</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Tum demum redderetur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis, ſi illi non ſatisficeret, vel per nos, vel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro nominae per alium, atqui id per Chriſtum eſt ſatisfactum qui non venit ſolvere ſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plere.

                     <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, being taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the <hi>propoſition</hi> is firm and undeniable. The <hi>aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is, that by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt the Law is fully ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>For the cleering whereof we are to underſtand, that to the full ſatisfying of the Law, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> two things are neceſſarily required, the one hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the penalty, to the ſuffering vvhereof, <hi>ſin</hi> hath made us lyable, the other to the precept it ſelf, to the performing and compleating whereof the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf doth oblige us; The former to free us from Hell and damnation, the other to intitle us to <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation:</hi> according to the <hi>Sanction</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> if <hi>thou doeſt not that which is commanded, thou art thereby accurſed;</hi> but if thou do, <hi>then thou ſhall be ſaved:</hi> In reſpect of the former, the Law cannot be ſatisfied in the behalf of him, who hath once tranſgreſſed it, but by eternal puniſhment, or that at leaſt which is <hi>equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> thereunto; in reſpect of the latter, it is not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but by a <hi>total perfect</hi> and <hi>perpetual obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now our Saviour Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied the Law for all them that truly believe in him in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; For he hath ſuper-abundantly ſatisfied the penalty of the Law for us, by his ſufferings and death:

                        </gap>rd reaſon is vvound up thus; That which makes a juſtified perſon compleatly righteous before God, is the <hi>formal</hi> cauſe of juſtification; But <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins maketh a juſtified perſon compleatly righteous before God, becauſe, ſay they, he is as cleer from ſin, and the guilt thereof, as if he had fulfilled the whole Law, and never tranſgreſſed any part or particle of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>We reply, 1. That making is an <hi>ambiguous</hi> term, and cannot vvithout more light, then they afford us, be fully discerned or diſcovered; For every <hi>cauſe</hi> maketh, the <hi>Efficient,</hi> the <hi>Material,</hi> the <hi>Formal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Remiſsion</hi> of ſins maketh not a perſon <hi>formally</hi> righteous, and therefore vve deny the reaſon: For though he be free from the guilt of ſin, yea, ſo righteous as here they ſpeak of; yet the cauſe is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt <hi>imputed,</hi> by whoſe obedience he is conſtituted juſt; Again, they argue, for the proof
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118687:61"/> of this, thus, That righteouſneſs which needs not fear the preſence of a moſt <hi>ſtrict judge,</hi> is a compleat and perfect righteouſneſs; But <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins is ſuch; And now they think themſelves cock ſure; for this, ſay they, will hold weight and meaſure. But let them take our anſwer with them for all their haſt, which will, we ſuppoſe, take them off their confidence, and it is this; That which theſe <hi>socinians</hi> are to prove, they often ſhift their hands of, and would have us take for granted, which we cannot do, without <hi>prejudice</hi> to the truth; They are here to prove, that <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins is a <hi>compleat righteouſneſs,</hi> but that which they endeavour to prove it by (as the ingenuous Reader may plainly perceive) beggeth the queſtion; namely, that it is righteouſneſs: For every thing that will abide the preſence of God, is not by and by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, much leſſe <hi>compleat</hi> righteouſneſs, as they would have us believe, upon their bare word: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the contrary, in love there is no fear, <hi>for perfect love caſteth out fear</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. 4.17, 18.</note>, yet it is not righteouſneſs, not that righteouſneſs, by which we are juſtified.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, ſay they, <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins reacheth home, and is given to men by God for their juſtification; Therefore it is the <hi>formal</hi> cauſe thereof; This they tell us is evident, becauſe by the <hi>formal</hi> cauſe, they mean nothing elſe but <hi>paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. That many things may be, and are given by God for juſtification in ſome way or other, which are not the <hi>formal</hi> cauſe thereof; for inſtance, the Word of God, and Faith, are given by God for juſtification, yet will any man therefore in his right wits conclude, that they are the <hi>formal</hi> cauſe of a ſinners juſtification?</p>

God (the Searcher of all hearts) ſhall witneſs for me, that I have not ceas'd to declare unto you, while I was with you, even the whole counſel of God, eſpecially by thoſe Doctrines which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be moſt needful and neceſſary for you: And being now departing from you, I commend this poor Piece as a laſting monument of my Affection to you; Therefore (<hi>I</hi> pray) accept this free will Offering with the ſame hand and heart it is tendered to you. <hi>I</hi> have not wrote any thing to the prejudice of the perſon of the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:118687:70"/> a croud, without any notice taken of it. I do not, cannot look to eſcape cenſures abroad, no more then <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> did perils, and among the rest, eſpecially by falſe Brethren, who are poſſeſſed with ſuch a ſpirit of Pride and Bitterneſs, that ſcorning and reviling the works of others, how pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and elaborate ſoever, they think nothing well done, but what they do themſelves: Let me therefore (my good friends) find kindneſs and curteſie from you at home, lest it repent me, not that I undertook, and by Gods mercy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but that ever I publiſhed theſe weak endeavours of mine. I have here unmasked Errour and Hereſie, that you may the better ſee them, and ſeeing, know them, and knowing, avoid them, when you ſhall meet them in what ever Paint or Dreſs of Piety and Purity they ſhall ſeek to ſhroud or ſhelter themſelves, ſo that you be not deceived by them.</p>
                  <p>I have made uſe of ſuch Authors in the managing of this high and holy buſineſs, as have gone before me, and were needful for me: They (I ſuppoſe) may paſs currant without any prejudice, or prejudicial cenſure: But my ſelf, and what is mine, do importune your favour, which, I preſume, will be the eaſier attained, in regard we both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing but good unto you.</p>
                  <p>We are they (my friends) upon whom the very Ends of the World are come; in which, not only <hi>homo homini Lupus,</hi> one man is a Wolf to another, preying upon the Body, Name, and Eſtate; but <hi>homo homini Daemon,</hi> one man is a Divel to another, labouring to enſnare and betray the Souls, the precious Souls one of another. It is very neceſſary then that we take heed unto our ſelves, that we be not ſlightly carryed on to our own deſtruction. What caution the Apostle gave his <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> the ſame do I give to you; <hi>Let no man ſpoil you through Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
<pb facs="tcp:118687:70"/> and vain deceit:</hi> And further give me leave to ſay, let no man ſpoil you through Divinity and vain deceit: For no doubt, but the Serpent hath his poyſon in his head, as well as his tayl; and the Divel hath his baits as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſet on, and as covertly laid in the depths of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as in the ſhallows of <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> yea rather did he attempt to have ſpoyl'd the great Commander of Divines with the Theorems of Divinity, then with the Rudiments of Philoſophy; he can frame either, or both, according to the times, places, or perſons with whom he hath to deal, to ſerve his purpoſe, and make for his advantage.</p>
                  <p>Let us then conſider, what is, or ought to be the credit, countenance, and authority of him that writeth any thing in publike; not his Perſon, though it be Comly; nor his Deportment, though it be Demure; nor his Name, though it be Famous; nor his Learning, though it be Profound, nor his Language, though it be Pleaſing; nor his Stile, though it be Smooth. But rather the Spirit (if not only the Spirit) by which he is guided. For otherwiſe were he as grave and ancient as <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> as wiſe and well learned as <hi>Solomon,</hi> as eloquent and well-ſpoken as <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> were he brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> or might he ſit in the Gates of the City for his Judgment and great ability, yet if in theſe the Spirit of Truth accompany him not, we are ſo far from receiving any good from him, that there is the more danger to be infected by him.</p>
                  <p>And though the only or ſpecial credit of him that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, be the Spirit by which he doth it; yet we muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every one that pretendeth he hath the Spirit. There are many falſe Prophets gone out into the world, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times (ſuch are the unſeaſoned and unſavoury judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men) they are taken, though miſtaken, to have the Spirit of Truth, which indeed are but Spirits of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
<pb facs="tcp:118687:71"/> And again, they are eſteem'd as Spirits of Error, in whom the spirit of Truth doth reſide, and hath taken up his Habitation. We had need therefore be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to what and whom we do give heed, ſo as to follow, or be led by it; and how we judge, leſt we be judged for it. Now the very God of Truth, by his spirit, the spirit of Truth, guide us into all Truth, and keep us blameleſs therein, that we waver not our ſelves, nor give occaſion to others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it, by our diſorderly walking in the Profeſſion of it; which is the earneſt Prayer, and hath been the careful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of</p>

This <hi>Synode</hi> took rather another courſe with him, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him for an <hi>heretick,</hi> condemned his books, and committed them to the fire, there to be conſumed as they juſtly deſerved.

But to this, that good man <hi>Zanchy</hi> gives a full, and a <hi>ſolid</hi> anſwer; Firſt, that there are not ſo many, nor ſo great contentions among us, who profeſſe the true <hi>faith,</hi> as the <hi>Devil,</hi> and his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices</hi> would make the World believe, thereby to bring the <hi>truth</hi> into <hi>ſuſpicion:</hi> And then, that thoſe, which are among us, are no <hi>argument</hi> of doubting of the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but rather of approving
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:118687:113"/> it: For the continued, and <hi>common condition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> here is <hi>militant,</hi> and ſubject to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi> only in <hi>Heaven</hi> it is already in part, and ſhall be hereafter, wholly <hi>triumphant.</hi> Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives the <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>caution</hi> hereof, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, which come to you;</hi> Not to <hi>Turks,</hi> not to <hi>Infidels,</hi> and yet to theſe, but not to theſe only, but to you alſo, to you <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>eſpecially,</hi> who have the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and to whom <hi>God</hi> affords the means of <hi>Salvation.</hi> The Devil is let looſe for a ſeaſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.

                     </p>
                     <p>He wrote divers <hi>Orations,</hi> and <hi>political admonitions.</hi> In the <hi>Bodlejan</hi> library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> are to be ſeen, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers works of his, as the <hi>ſignification</hi> of <hi>Comets;</hi> divers,

An <hi>Epiſtle</hi> concerning the inflicting of <hi>capital</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>hereticks.</hi> The life of <hi>Cardinal Pool</hi> was drawn out by his <hi>artificial</hi> hand, and <hi>flouriſhed</hi> by his pen. There are divers letters alſo of <hi>Socinus</hi> to him, by which at firſt he <hi>ſolicited</hi> and and as is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <hi>gained</hi> him to his party. <hi>Raemundus</hi> reporteth of him, <hi>that being invited by a certain friend of his to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who earneſtly requested his company, at that time in good health, free from all ſenſe, or the least ſuſpicion of ſickneſs, much leſſe of death, gave the Meſsenger this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; his friend muſt have him excuſed, for that he was at that very time to go another way, and had ſome other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of greater conſequence to do;</hi> Namely, to pay the laſt debt which he owed to <hi>nature,</hi> which accordingly, at that very time he did, and ſo departed. Truly this man was much to be pitied, who having forſaken a bad, yet choſe no better, a <hi>religion,</hi> then which a worſe, could not be raked out of Hell: giving himſelf over to the <hi>Socinian faction,</hi> in whoſe <hi>destructive opinions,</hi> as he lived: So he dyed, without comfort.

Apoſtacy</hi> of <hi>manners</hi> cannot but be <hi>dangerous,</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> deadly: together with <hi>truth</hi> it looſeth <hi>ſhame;</hi> and not ſeldom ſwells up to <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghost,</hi> for which there is no forgiveneſs in <hi>Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be no remorſe on earth.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:118687:115"/> in the heart of man, that neither he himſelf is, nor ſhall the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> be, if he can help it, at any quiet, through his <hi>miſgrounded novelty,</hi> and moſt <hi>dangerous hereſy,</hi> to which he ſtands extreamly affected.</p>
                     <p>Can it be any other then an <hi>height</hi> of <hi>pride,</hi> for a man to think himſelf wiſer then the <hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon earth? wiſer then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that hath bin upon earth, ever ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt incluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely</hi> in all <hi>ſucceſſions</hi> to this preſent time? It was this <hi>pride</hi> that undid <hi>Puccius,</hi> and brought him back with ſhame to that <hi>religion,</hi> which he had diſclaimed. And many ſuch examples have we of divers, who have ſtrayed from the <hi>truth,</hi> to the <hi>Samoſatenian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> aſſemblies, ye tat length have foully miſcarryed, either returning back to <hi>Popery,</hi> from whence at firſt they took their flight, or elſe to <hi>Iudaiſme</hi> or <hi>Turciſme,</hi> which is worſt of all; That Spirit which <hi>beareth rule in the hearts of the Children of diſobedience,</hi> bringeth them about with, ſuch a <hi>giddineſs</hi> of mind, that without, <hi>Gods</hi> ſpecial preventing <hi>grace,</hi> there is no help for them. And no marvel they are ſo ready to turn <hi>Turcks</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> that are once entred into the <hi>Socinian Doctrines,</hi> For they are ſo like, that there is not a <hi>pin</hi> to chuſe.</p>

                     <p>TO be looſe in the main joynts of <hi>Religion</hi> is very bad, and gives the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> great advantage againſt us; we may ſee the truth of this in the example here ſet before us; <hi>Jacob Palaeologus</hi> of the <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>Jmperial family</hi> of the <hi>Graecian Palaeologi,</hi> came from his own country to <hi>Rome,</hi> where having ſpent ſome time, in obſerving the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Orders</hi> which were there, he choſe (as being moſt, and beſt affected with their <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi>) the order of the <hi>Fryer Dominickes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to whoſe rule he lived and conformed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:118687:120"/> and went into <hi>Poland</hi> to the <hi>Arians,</hi> as they were then called, to whoſe <hi>hereſy</hi> he was ſo cloſely rivetted, that he was never looſed from them to his dying day. He that hath ſtrayed into theſe thickets, is ſo amazed with <hi>intricate circumnolutions,</hi> that he can very hardly unwind himſelf ever after. Now he paſſeth from thence to <hi>Moravia,</hi> where he manifeſts his affection to theſe <hi>deſperate opinions,</hi> which he formerly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and digeſted; Here he makes all ring again, ſo that neither <hi>Scriptures, Patriarchs, Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Apoſtles,</hi> no nor <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf can be heard for him, and his <hi>Socinians. Pope Pius V.</hi> did his utmoſt endeavour to catch him in his traps, which he had laid in ſeveral places, and by ſeveral perſons for him, but while he lived, he kept out of his clutches. But <hi>Gregory the</hi> 13. by the means of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the 2. brought it to paſſe, that being at dinner with ſome other company, he was ſuddainly apprehended, clapt up into a coach, which ſtood ready provided for him, was brought firſt to <hi>Vienna,</hi> from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was made ſure enough for ever eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping again. He was often examined by the <hi>Jeſuites Magius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and being conuicted of <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> which it ſeems ſtuck cloſer to him then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>profeſſion,</hi> he was for the preſent doomed to the deep dungeon of the tower of <hi>Nonnana,</hi> into which, his hands, feet, and neck being laden with gyves and fetters, he was miſerably thruſt down, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main til farther order ſhould be taken with him. Where in the mean time, he had divers exhortations and admonitions to forſake thoſe <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> into which he was fallen.

When he came to the place of execution, and beheld the fire prepared for him, with certain <hi>Sorcerers</hi> ſtanding ready bound to their ſtakes, which were to be burned with him, he was ſo exceedingly terrified, and wholly agaſt, that he gave publick teſtimony of his will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The fear of death ſtriketh us into ſuch a dump, that we are contented to do any thing, rather then dye. By the way, what is it, ſhould make us ſo unwilling to dye, ſeeing it is a debt we owe to <hi>nature,</hi> and the payment thereof cannot be avoyded? Is it the <hi>horrour</hi> of the pain that doth affright us? Is if the fear and doubt of what ſhall become of us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after that doth terrify us? Or, is it the guilt of our miſguided ſouls, already condemning us, by the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion</hi> of a <hi>future</hi> puniſhment, which waits upon us?

The cauſe of this difference is not in death, but in our ſelves; for death comes alike to all, but finds not all alike when it comes.

                        <hi>ſpecially</hi> or <hi>properly.</hi> We do not deny the <hi>Socinians</hi> to be called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in the firſt ſenſe, that is, the <hi>general</hi> or <hi>improper</hi> ſignification of the word; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever does acknowledge that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is that promiſed <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and that his Doctrine is only to be embraced and obeyed by us, are ſuch <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> making a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and <hi>Jews,</hi> who deny that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> is already come; and <hi>Turks</hi> who profeſſe and follow the Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet</hi> contained in their <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran:</hi> We give them this to diſtinguiſh them from <hi>Infidels</hi> which know not <hi>Christ,</hi> and from <hi>Jews</hi> which deny <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but we cannot give them the title of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in that <hi>ſpecial</hi> ſenſe, in which the Scriptures
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118687:125"/> uſe it; nor may they <hi>proudly arrogate</hi> it to themſelves, for they are not worthy of it: And this we make good by theſe enſuing <hi>Arguments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are the <hi>peculiar</hi> Diſciples of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Act. 11.26. But the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> are not the <hi>peculiar</hi> Diſciples of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſeeing they diſſent from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in very many <hi>myſteries</hi> and <hi>principal foundations</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian faith,</hi> and do their utmoſt endeavour by their <hi>ſubtilties,</hi> to overthrow them: Therefore the <hi>Socinians,</hi> notwithſtanding their <hi>glorious outſide profeſsion,</hi> are not <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is required to the compleating, and making up of a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a true and lively <hi>faith,</hi> or an acknowledging, and ſincere <hi>profeſsion</hi> of the true <hi>faith, Rom.</hi> 10.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. But they whoſe <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>profeſsion</hi> concerning <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not true, but <hi>falſe, erroneous</hi> and <hi>heretical,</hi> are not to be accounted for true <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> But the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>profeſsion</hi> of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> both concerning <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>erroneous,</hi> yea and <hi>heretical</hi> too, as we ſhall ſhew out of the Scriptures, and ſhall ſet forth to the judgment of the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Socinians</hi> are not to be accounted or eſteemed as true <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They which worſhip any other, then the only true <hi>God,</hi> are not true <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> worſhip another, and not the true <hi>God;</hi> for they adore not, neither do they worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They which deny the proper <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are not to be counted <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> For as he which denyeth the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Man, taketh away man; ſo he which denyeth the <hi>proper Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> taketh away <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo is not truly a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> But the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny the <hi>proper Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe they deny the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Eſſence,</hi> being <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Jer. 23.6. <hi>God bleſſed for ever, Amen,</hi> Rom. 9.5.

                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, he which confeſſeth not that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is come in the fleſh, or denies, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not truly a <hi>Christian,</hi> but is to be accounted as an <hi>Anti-chriſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.22.23. 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 5.7. But the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come in the fleſh, becauſe they deny the <hi>incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is urged by <hi>St. Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>Epistle.</hi> 4.2. and 1. <hi>of his Goſpel,</hi> 14. againſt <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> as <hi>predeceſſors</hi> of the <hi>Socinian hereſie.</hi> And although in words they confeſſe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet in deed they deny it, both becauſe they take away his <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> or <hi>Son-ſhip,</hi> whereby he is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> of the <hi>ſubstance</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, They which ſerve the creature beſides <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Creator,</hi> and do <hi>Religiouſly</hi> worſhip him, which is not <hi>God,</hi> they as ſuch, are rather <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> then <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> But the <hi>Socinians</hi> do ſerve the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beſides <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Creator,</hi> and adore him with <hi>Religious</hi> worſhip, who by nature is not <hi>God,</hi> namely their <hi>falſe,</hi> and fained <hi>Christ,</hi> who they themſelves ſay, is not <hi>God,</hi> yet give him <hi>divine adoration.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Socinians</hi> are rather <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> then true <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and are ſo to be accounted by us.</p>
                     <p>Thus my <hi>dear Country men,</hi> You have ſeen what theſe men are; whoſe <hi>damnable opinions</hi> do miſlead us, what in their <hi>lives,</hi> what in their <hi>Doctrines:</hi> why ſhould we rake the <hi>Sinks</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>drain</hi> the <hi>Puddles</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> for thoſe <hi>Hereſies</hi> which have both <hi>infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>infected</hi> the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in thoſe parts, and in diverſe other places beſide?
